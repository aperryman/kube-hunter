# {{ page.vid }} - {{ page.title }}

## Issue description

The logs in the pods file system are accessible without authentication.  By having access to pod logs, you will have access to potentially sensitive data output by the pods system and applications.  Whilst this hunter only checks for read access to the `/var/log/` directory, if you have access here then you might have read access elsewhere on the pods file system. 

## Remediation

Ensure kubelet is protected using `--anonymous-auth=false` kubelet flag. Allow only legitimate users using `--client-ca-file` or `--authentication-token-webhook` kubelet flags. This is usually done by the installer or cloud provider.

Review the RBAC permissions to Kubernetes API server for the anonymous and default service account, including bindings.
